# towers-backend
This project contains the backend related code to the towers multiplayer game. It currently only consists of a firebase schema specification written in [Bolt](https://github.com/firebase/bolt/blob/master/docs/guide.md).

## rules.bolt
The **rules.bolt** file contains the database structure, a description for data validation (different type declarations/mappings) and it also handles authorization (so who can manipulate or read what kind of data).
